# Tangle Network: An MPC-as-a-service blockchain restaking infrastructure

## Introduction

The Tangle Network is a pioneering blockchain platform, uniquely positioned to advance cross-chain and zero-knowledge (ZK) applications within a collaborative ecosystem. Built on the robust Substrate framework, Tangle seamlessly combines Multi-Party Computation (MPC) primitives with an innovative restaking mechanism. This fusion not only empowers developers to forge privacy-enhancing ZK applications and cross-chain solutions but also establishes a decentralized, crypto-economically secured service landscape.

Central to Tangle's ethos is the creation of a united community of developers, validators, and innovators, all driven to co-create cutting-edge, privacy-preserving applications. By focusing on the development of specific MPC-driven blockchain solutions, such as Threshold Signature as a Service (TSSaaS) and Proof Generation as a Service (ZKSaaS), Tangle offers tangible benefits across its user base:

**For Application Developers:** Unlock scalable and secure development environments with MPC solutions, ensuring seamless integration into existing and future projects.
**For Protocol Developers:** Explore new horizons and contribute to the MPC infrastructure through innovative protocol upgrades, enhancing the network's capabilities.
**For Validators:** Participate in Tangle's restaking framework to earn additional rewards while providing essential cryptographic services to the network.

## Key Features

- **MPC-as-a-Service (MaaS)**: Tangle natively supports various multi-party computation primitives and zero-knowledge proving services that facilitate the development of new applications, particularly in the privacy-preserving space. These services benefit the Tangle community by positioning the network as a core infrastructure for any ZK application across multiple ecosystems.

- **Restaking**: Tangle's restaking system is directly integrated into its MPC-as-a-Service infrastructure. Validators can restake directly on the set of roles available to them in the runtime, with each role representing an eligible service. This mechanism incentivizes validators to provide high-quality MPC services.

- **Interoperability**: Tangle is dedicated to enabling fluid cross-chain interactions, from asset bridging to advanced cross-chain communication. We imagine this will be achieved through various technologies such as private bridges, zkBridges, IBC pallets, and XCM.

- **EVM Compatibility**: The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a critical component of Tangle Network, serving as a conduit for compatibility and interoperability with Ethereum-based tools and applications. Developers can seamlessly construct decentralized applications (DApps), generate Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and utilize ERC20 tokens across diverse networks.

## Services

Tangle Network offers a range of services to support the development and deployment of advanced cryptographic applications:

- **Signing as a Service (TSSaaS)**: Tangle provides threshold signatures as a service, enabling the creation of decentralized bridges, oracles, and custody solutions. This service leverages a distributed key generation protocol to ensure robust security.

- **zkSNARKs as a Service (zkSaaS)**: To address the computational challenges faced by resource-constrained devices when running ZK applications, Tangle offers proof generation as a service. This allows developers to outsource the proof generation process to a privacy-preserving infrastructure.

- **Trusted Setups as a Service (TaaS)**: Tangle streamlines the trusted setup process for ZK applications by providing this as a service. This reduces the friction for developers, enabling them to deploy ZK applications to production without organizing a trusted setup themselves.

## Governance and Community

Tangle Network employs an advanced governance model underpinned by a Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol. This protocol serves as a security mechanism for the network's cross-chain applications, validating bridge updates with crypto-economically protected threshold signatures.

The Tangle community is a vibrant mix of developers, privacy researchers, decentralized app (dApp) users, bridge users, and token holders. Community members assume various roles within the ecosystem, including technology advocates, validators, data relayers, governance participants, and open-source contributors.

## Conclusion

Tangle Network introduces an innovative platform to support cross-chain Zero-Knowledge (ZK) applications and enhance privacy in the blockchain ecosystem. With its unique offering of MPC-as-a-Service, restaking mechanism, and commitment to interoperability, Tangle is well-positioned to become a core infrastructure for enabling privacy-first and interoperable blockchain solutions.

As the network continues to evolve, it aims to expand its services, foster community growth, and drive the adoption of advanced cryptographic techniques in the blockchain space. Tangle Network invites developers, validators, and users to join its mission of building a more private, secure, and interconnected decentralized future.
