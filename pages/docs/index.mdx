# Tangle Network: An MPC-as-a-service blockchain restaking infrastructure

## Introduction

The Tangle Network is a groundbreaking blockchain platform designed to support cross-chain and zero-knowledge (ZK) applications. Built on the advanced Substrate framework, Tangle Network offers a suite of multi-party computation (MPC) primitives on-demand, empowering developers to create privacy-enhancing ZK applications, cross-chain solutions, and other complex, cryptographically secure decentralized applications.

At the core of Tangle Network is its innovative restaking mechanism. This allows validators from Tangle and other networks to provide MPC services to paying customers over a decentralized network, earning rewards in the process. The combination of restaking and MPC services enables Tangle to function as an outsourced, crypto-economically secured service provider.

## Key Features

- **MPC-as-a-Service (MaaS)**: Tangle natively supports various multi-party computation primitives and zero-knowledge proving services that facilitate the development of new applications, particularly in the privacy-preserving space. These services benefit the Tangle community by positioning the network as a core infrastructure for any ZK application across multiple ecosystems.

- **Restaking**: Tangle's restaking system is directly integrated into its MPC-as-a-Service infrastructure. Validators can restake directly on the set of roles available to them in the runtime, with each role representing an eligible service. This mechanism incentivizes validators to provide high-quality MPC services.

- **Interoperability**: Tangle is dedicated to enabling fluid cross-chain interactions, from asset bridging to advanced cross-chain communication. We imagine this will be achieved through various technologies such as private bridges, zkBridges, IBC pallets, and XCM.

- **EVM Compatibility**: The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a critical component of Tangle Network, serving as a conduit for compatibility and interoperability with Ethereum-based tools and applications. Developers can seamlessly construct decentralized applications (DApps), generate Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and utilize ERC20 tokens across diverse networks.

## Services

Tangle Network offers a range of services to support the development and deployment of advanced cryptographic applications:

- **Signing as a Service (TSSaaS)**: Tangle provides threshold signatures as a service, enabling the creation of decentralized bridges, oracles, and custody solutions. This service leverages a distributed key generation protocol to ensure robust security.

- **zkSNARKs as a Service (zkSaaS)**: To address the computational challenges faced by resource-constrained devices when running ZK applications, Tangle offers proof generation as a service. This allows developers to outsource the proof generation process to a privacy-preserving infrastructure.

- **Trusted Setups as a Service (TaaS)**: Tangle streamlines the trusted setup process for ZK applications by providing this as a service. This reduces the friction for developers, enabling them to deploy ZK applications to production without organizing a trusted setup themselves.

## Governance and Community

Tangle Network employs an advanced governance model underpinned by a Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol. This protocol serves as a security mechanism for the network's cross-chain applications, validating bridge updates with crypto-economically protected threshold signatures.

The Tangle community is a vibrant mix of developers, privacy researchers, decentralized app (dApp) users, bridge users, and token holders. Community members assume various roles within the ecosystem, including technology advocates, validators, data relayers, governance participants, and open-source contributors.

## Conclusion

Tangle Network introduces an innovative platform to support cross-chain Zero-Knowledge (ZK) applications and enhance privacy in the blockchain ecosystem. With its unique offering of MPC-as-a-Service, restaking mechanism, and commitment to interoperability, Tangle is well-positioned to become a core infrastructure for enabling privacy-first and interoperable blockchain solutions.

As the network continues to evolve, it aims to expand its services, foster community growth, and drive the adoption of advanced cryptographic techniques in the blockchain space. Tangle Network invites developers, validators, and users to join its mission of building a more private, secure, and interconnected decentralized future.
