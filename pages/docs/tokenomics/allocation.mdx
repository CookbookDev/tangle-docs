### Prototypical Genesis Allocations

Using aggregated data on successful networks as a benchmark, Tangle Net has tailored its genesis allocation to meet its unique needs and goals.

### Vesting Schedule
Vesting schedules in Tangle Network are meticulously designed to promote long-term commitment and ensure a phased distribution of tokens. The network adopts a structured vesting strategy with distinct categories:

- **A-Vesting**: This category entails a vesting period of 2 years with a 1-year cliff. This means that upon completing the first year, the allocation for that year vests immediately, ensuring a staggered release of tokens. The remaining year is distributed monthly in 1/12 increments. 

- **B-Vesting**: Upon claiming, 5% of the tokens become immediately liquid, while the remaining 95% of tokens under B-Vesting are distributed over 2 years with a commencement one month post-allocation. Post-cliff, tokens vest linearly with each blockchain block, distributing a proportionate amount of tokens until the conclusion of the 2-year period. 


### Detailed Allocation Overview

The Tangle Network's allocation model is designed to support our foundational structures, incentivize community participation, and ensure long-term sustainability and success:

- **Contributors** allocation supports the core teams and advisors essential for the network's development and strategic direction.
- **Airdrops** are aimed at rewarding early supporters and participants, fostering a strong and engaged community from the outset.
- **Treasury** funds are earmarked for community decisionmaking, future development, network success programs, liquidity provisions, and partnerships critical for launch and growth.
