# Tangle Network Mainnet Launch

## Launch Date

- **Mainnet Activation**: Scheduled for April 10, 2024, Tangle Network will make its entrance as a fully operational NPoS network, virtually permissionless, decentralized and community governed from the start. Validators will be able to participate in validation on the 10th.

## NPoS Launch and Operations

- **NPoS Framework**: Upon launch, Tangle Network will adopt a Nominated Proof of Stake model as its foundational security mechanism. This allows TNT holders to engage directly in the network's security by nominating validators they trust to be responsible for block production and transaction validation.
- **Validator Participation**: Validators are essential to the network's integrity and performance from the very beginning. Potential validators are thus encouraged to prepare for their roles by learning to stake TNT tokens and signaling their commitment to maintaining network protocols.

## Governance Activation

- **Initial Governance**: Concurrent with the NPoS launch, governance modules will be activated, granting TNT holders the power to participate in decision-making processes through proposals, referenda, and council elections, ensuring a democratic approach to the network's development.
- **Webb's Sudo Key Role**: Initially, Webb, a core development team, will hold a Sudo key to ensure smooth operations and governance transitions. This temporary measure allows for efficient implementation of critical updates and decisions during the early stages of the network.
- **Sudo Key Deactivation**: A timeline is in place for deactivating the Sudo key, transitioning to a fully decentralized governance model. This significant step is expected to occur within the first few months after launch, with input from the token holders to affirm the network's readiness.

## Core Functionality

- **Balances and Transfers**: From launch day, TNT token balances will be active, with token transfer capabilities generally enabled to ensure liquidity and participation in the network's economy. **If you recieve tokens through the airdrop or other allocation processes, up to 95% of these may be subject to a lockup. [See the Allocation page for details.](allocation.mdx)**
- **Community Proposals for Additional Features**: Post-launch, the community will be empowered to propose and vote on activating additional core functionalities. This encompasses enhanced transaction types, new governance mechanisms, and network upgrades, among others.
