# TNT Token Utility

The Tangle Network introduces its native token, TNT, pivotal in driving the network's unique capabilities in Zero-Knowledge (ZK) and Multiparty Computation (MPC) as-a-service on its platform. TNT plays a multifaceted role, underpinning the entire ecosystem's operation and governance. Here's how TNT integrates into Tangle Network's innovative framework:

## TNT Token Utility and Network Dynamics
**Consensus and Economic Model:** The Tangle Network dynamically mints or burns TNT tokens to reward consensus protocol participants, fund its treasury, manage inflation, and ensure the network's economic stability.

**ZK and MPC Operations** TNT serves as the currency for transactions between job submitters and validators within the Tangle Network's ZK and MPC services. This facilitates seamless, secure, and efficient execution of complex computations and privacy-preserving operations.

**Validator Restaking:** Validators are required to restake TNT tokens to maintain their role in performing ZK and MPC services. This mechanism promotes ongoing commitment and participation in the network's core functionalities.

**Slashing Mechanisms:** To safeguard against malicious activities, TNT tokens are integral to Tangle's slashing protocols. These measures are designed to deter attacks and incentivize adherence to network protocols.

**Governance Empowerment:** TNT holders wield governance power, enabling them to partake in pivotal network decisions through referenda. This democratic approach ensures that the Tangle Network evolves in alignment with its community's interests.


Through the Substrate-standard proof-of-stake model, Tangle Network aims to foster a robust and secure ecosystem. Validators and nominators play a critical role, with validators facilitating block production and consensus, while nominators back their preferred validators, contributing to network integrity. 

A considerable portion of TNT will be actively engaged in the network, either staked by validators and nominators for network security or utilized in the execution of ZK and MPC tasks. This not only ensures the network's resilience and security but also drives engagement and utility within the Tangle ecosystem.
